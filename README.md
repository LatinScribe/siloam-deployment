This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You should install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i

npm i prisma

npx prisma generate

npx prisma migrate dev

npm run dev
```

To see data base, run the following:

```bash
npm i # if not already done

npx prisma generate

npx prisma migrate dev

npx prisma studio
```

GENERAL RULES:
- DO NOT EVER PUSH NODE MODULES!!!!!!!
- if you modify prisma schema, remember to run npx prisma migrate dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.
